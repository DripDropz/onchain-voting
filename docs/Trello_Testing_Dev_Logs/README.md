# Testing and Development Logs Archive

This repository contains screenshot captures from the original Trello boards used during the testing and development phase of the Open Source Voting Initiative.

The original Trello workspace and boards are no longer accessible for edits or live updates. Screenshots were captured to preserve the retrievable historical record of development activity, testing progress, issue tracking and resolution notes.

These screenshots represent an accurate snapshot of the state of the project during active development and testing. They include task movement across stages, testing notes, implementation discussions and resolution confirmations as they existed at the time of archival.

This repository exists to provide transparency and verifiable evidence of the development and testing process for auditors, contributors and community reviewers. While the screenshots are not interactive, they serve as a faithful record of work completed and decisions made during the lifecycle of the initiative.

Future development and testing logs for the Open Source Voting Initiative will be maintained using accessible and open tooling here on GitHub to ensure long term availability and community visibility.
