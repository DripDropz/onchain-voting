# DripDropz Open Source On-Chain Voting #

## Description ##

The goal of this code is to provide information, a framework, and ultimately a full-stack solution to users and 
organizations seeking to conduct governance or voting on the Cardano blockchain.

## Rationale ##

Key features that have informed design decisions of this platform include, but are not limited, to the following:

- **Public Auditability**: It is the belief of our team that all pertinent and relevant information concerning a vote to be
  cast on-chain should be fully transparent and publicly auditable to all users (not withstanding some technical prowess)
  at any time past or present without reliance on 3rd parties.
- **Vote Security**: Particularly when conducting a vote utilizing on-chain assets (native $ADA or other native assets) the
  paramount importance is proof of voter participation intent. This is not to be confused with voter collusion which
  shall be addressed separately based upon historical observations.
- **Ease of Use**: The voting platform should be as easy to use, understand, and participate with as possible to 
  maximize voter participation in any particular vote or governance matter.

## Other Ecosystem Developers and Participants ##

- **DripDropz**: This platform was built out of the work performed on behalf of DripDropz to conduct on-chain governance
  voting utilizing the $DRIP native asset. We have conducted several successful votes utilizing the techniques and
  solutions described in this repository. It has always been our goal to give back to the Cardano community by open
  sourcing solutions to common problems.
  - More information and historic vote results available at: [https://dripdropz.io/vote/](https://dripdropz.io/vote/)
- **SundaeSwap**: The team at SundaeSwap has been hard at work on their own version of on-chain governance using Merkle Tree
  roll-ups to the blockchain to provide vote auditability.
  - More information available at: [https://services.sundaeswap.finance/](https://services.sundaeswap.finance/)
- **Voteaire**: The team at Voteaire has created a simple and easy to use voting platform that is open and available today to
  all ecosystem participants. This platform was built out as an expansion to the earlier work performed by members of 
  the DripDropz Team, the Voteaire Team, and other community participants on behalf of SPOCRA.
  - Platform Available at: [https://voteaire.io](https://voteaire.io).
  - Github: [https://github.com/voteaire/voteaire-onchain-spec/](https://github.com/voteaire/voteaire-onchain-spec/)
- **SPOCRA**: The Stake Pool Operators Collective Representation Assemble (SPOCRA) conducted the very first on-chain voting
  on Cardano in late 2020. The status of the group itself is unknown at the time of writing but much of the early work
  done by the community and members of the DripDropz team to support and conduct the first SPOCRA votes has helped to 
  shape and grow our current platform.

- We are happy to add any other community-driven projects developing on-chain voting for the Cardano ecosystem. Please
  let us know about them in the GitHub Issues tab above, so we can add them!
